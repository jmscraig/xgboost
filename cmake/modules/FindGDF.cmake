# Tries to find GDF headers and libraries.
#
# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#  find_package(GDF)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  GDF_ROOT - When set, this path is inspected instead of standard library
#              locations as the root of the GDF installation.
#              The environment variable GDF_ROOT overrides this veriable.
#
# This module defines
#  GDF_FOUND, whether nccl has been found
#  GDF_INCLUDE_DIR, directory containing header
#  GDF_LIBRARY, directory containing nccl library
#  GDF_LIB_NAME, nccl library name
#
# This module assumes that the user has already called find_package(CUDA)
